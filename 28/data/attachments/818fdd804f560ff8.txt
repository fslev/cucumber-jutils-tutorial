org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: HTTP Response statuses do not match!

Strings do not match

Matching is by default case-sensitive and uses regular expressions.
If expected object contains any unintentional regexes, then quote them between \Q and \E delimiters.
For disabling case-sensitivity, use (?i) and (?-i) modifiers.

 ==> expected: <202> but was: <404>
